# Machine Learning Model for Tampering Detection in Secure Enclosures

## Overview

This project aims to design and 3D print secure enclosures for Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) with integrated sensors and machine learning to detect unauthorized access or tampering attempts in real-time. The custom enclosures feature embedded sensors and AI algorithms to continuously monitor and analyze physical security, providing enhanced protection for sensitive cryptographic keys and data.

## Project Components

1. **3D Printed Enclosures**
   - Custom designs to fit HSMs.
   - Robust to withstand physical tampering.
   - Mounting points for sensors.

2. **Embedded Sensors**
   - **Accelerometers:** Measure vibrations and movement.
   - **Gyroscopes:** Measure orientation and angular velocity.

3. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Real-time detection of tampering attempts using sensor data.

## Dataset

### Understanding the Dataset

**Components:**
- **Features:** Sensor readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes.
  - `accel_x`, `accel_y`, `accel_z`: Accelerometer readings in X, Y, and Z axes.
  - `gyro_x`, `gyro_y`, `gyro_z`: Gyroscope readings in X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Labels:** Indicate the condition of the enclosure.
  - `0`: Normal condition.
  - `1`: Tampered condition.

### Steps to Collect Data

1. **Set Up Your Sensors:**
   - Install and calibrate accelerometers and gyroscopes in your secure enclosure.

2. **Collect Data in Different Scenarios:**
   - **Normal Operation:** Record data during regular use.
   - **Tampering Scenarios:** Record data during simulated tampering attempts.

3. **Structure the Data:**
   - Organize in a CSV file format with sensor readings and labels.

### Sample Dataset

The dataset should be structured as follows:

```csv
accel_x,accel_y,accel_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z,label
0.01,0.02,0.98,0.05,0.02,0.03,0
0.02,0.03,0.97,0.06,0.03,0.02,0
0.01,0.01,0.99,0.04,0.01,0.03,0
0.05,0.06,0.90,0.10,0.08,0.05,1
0.04,0.05,0.91,0.12,0.09,0.06,1
0.02,0.02,0.96,0.08,0.05,0.07,0
```

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning:** Remove missing or erroneous values.
- **Normalization:** Scale sensor readings for consistency.

### Splitting the Data

- **Training Set:** For training the machine learning model.
- **Testing Set:** For evaluating model performance.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model is designed to distinguish between normal and tampered conditions using sensor data. The key steps include:

1. **Training:** The model is trained on a dataset of sensor readings labeled as normal or tampered.
2. **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using a separate testing set.
3. **Deployment:** The trained model is deployed to monitor real-time sensor data for tampering detection.

## PowerPoint Presentation

For a structured overview of the project, you can create a PowerPoint presentation that includes:

1. **Title Slide:** Project title and description.
2. **Introduction:** Objectives and components of the project.
3. **Design and 3D Printing:** Details about the enclosure design and printing process.
4. **Sensor Integration:** Information on sensor types and their integration.
5. **Machine Learning Model Development:** Steps for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
6. **Real-Time Tampering Detection:** How the model is used to detect tampering in real-time.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Methods for testing the system and validating its performance.
8. **Conclusion:** Summary and future work.
